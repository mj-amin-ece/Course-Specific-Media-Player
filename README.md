# Course-Specific-Media-Player

This project involves developing a media player tailored for the AP course. The media player should be able to play videos and display associated tags for each video. These tags are provided in an Excel file for every video, and the player should allow users to click on any tag to jump to the corresponding part of the video.

## Features
- **Video Playback**: The media player should support the playback of video files.
- **Tag Display**: Each video will have an associated Excel file containing tags. These tags should be displayed while the video plays.
- **Jump to Tag**: Clicking on any tag should cause the media player to jump to the part of the video corresponding to that tag.

## Requirements
- **Python**: This project is developed in Python.
- **Excel File Support**: The media player must be able to read and display tags from Excel files.

- ## Usage
- Load a video into the media player.
- The associated tags from the Excel file will be displayed.
